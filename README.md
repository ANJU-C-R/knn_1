           K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm Implementation for Milk Quality Prediction

Milk is an essential dietary component consumed worldwide, and its quality plays a crucial role in 
ensuring consumer health and satisfaction. The assessment of milk quality traditionally relies on manual 
inspection and laboratory testing, which can be time-consuming and subjective. With advancements in machine 
learning, automated predictive models can be developed to classify milk quality efficiently.

                            K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
                       
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. 
It is a non-parametric, instance-based algorithm.In classification, KNN assigns a class to a data point based on the majority vote
of its K nearest neighbors. The "distance" between points is typically measured using Euclidean distance, though other metrics like 
Manhattan or Minkowski can be used. The choice of K (number of neighbors) plays a crucial role in model accuracy—too small a K can 
lead to noise sensitivity, while too large a K may smooth out important patterns.

                                     Dataset Overview

 Dataset is taken from kaggle, which is uploaded as "milknew.csv",link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cpluzshrijayan/milkquality
The dataset used in this study consists of seven independent variables: pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity,
and Color, which are critical factors in determining milk quality.The target variable, Grade, categorizes
the milk into three quality levels:

              ✅Low (Bad)
              ✅Medium (Moderate)
              ✅High (Good)
              
In this project, we preprocess and analyze the dataset,and build predictive models to classify the quality of milk.The goal is 
to enhance quality control in the dairy industry by developing an efficient and reliable automated system for milk quality assessment.

     Step-by-Step Implementation of KNN Algorithm
     
1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing
Reading the dataset and inspecting its structure.
Checking for missing values and handling them by replacing them with the most frequent values (mode).
Dropping the ‘ID’ column, as it does not contribute to prediction.
Encoding categorical variables (like Gender, Smoking, Anxiety, etc.) into numerical form using Label Encoding for model compatibility.
2️⃣ Splitting Data into Features & Target Variable
Defining the feature matrix (X), which includes all predictor variables.
Defining the target variable (y), which contains the depression status (Yes/No).
3️⃣ Splitting Data into Training & Testing Sets
Dividing the dataset into 70% training data and 30% testing data using stratified sampling to ensure an even distribution of classes.
4️⃣ Feature Scaling Using Standardization
Since KNN is distance-based, different feature scales can negatively impact the model.
StandardScaler is applied to ensure all features have equal weight in distance computation.
5️⃣ Training the KNN Model
Initializing the KNN classifier with k=7, meaning it considers the 7 nearest neighbors for classification.
Training the model using the preprocessed training data.
6️⃣ Making Predictions on Test Data
The trained KNN model is used to predict depression status on the test dataset.
7️⃣ Evaluating Model Performance
Confusion Matrix Analysis
A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.
The confusion matrix provides insights into true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Accuracy Score & Classification Report
The accuracy score is computed to evaluate the overall performance of the model.
A classification report is generated, providing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

                                    Conclusion
                                    
This project successfully implements KNN classification to predict milk quality based on the depending features.
